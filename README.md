## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

This app allows the user to create, edit, and delete projects and tasks. They can mark tasks as complete/incomplete and as important/unimportant. Can also sort and filter tasks by date (daily or weekly) and sort and filter tasks by important status. All the data is stored in localStorage. This app also uses the date-fns library and the uuid library.

## Optimizations:

Instead of storing all the data in localStorage, I would go back to this project and make it into a full stack TodoList app using Node.js and Express for the backend and MongoDB as my database. I would also like to use React as the front-end framework for this app.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned more about using ES6 Modules and Webpack by creating this app. I also learned how to install and use external libraries. I used date-fns to help me sort and filter tasks by dates and uuid to generate unique ids for the tasks and projects.
